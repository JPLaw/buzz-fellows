# INSTRUCTIONS

Write user stories for each possible role. User stories follow the format of: As a ___, I want ___ so that ___. Remember, user stories tell...

Who needs a feature (and a brief descriptor of their role/relationship to the app)
What they want that feature to do
Why they want it
If you want a feature in the app, you MUST have at least one user story (preferably more, if multiple users want it) that requires it. No exceptions.

Write your user stories in a user-stories.md file in your repo.

# User Stories
- As a devloper I want to apply the knowledge that I have gain during the CF 201 course to make a fun and semi-informative quiz so that I can practice the skills that I have learned, impress those who interact with the site, and semi-help future students.
- As a developer I want the results page to be intuitive and readable and include fancy charts and graphs so that user can understand their results.
- As a user of the site I want to see the result of my peers and be able to return to the site and see my own results, so that I can compare myself to other and feel good about myself.
- As a potential employer I want to see information about the developers of the site, so that I can be impressed and hire them immediately.
- As user I want to be asked a variety of types of questions so that I feel engaged.
- As a code fellows student I want to have a pleasant user experience with a website that doens't look terrible or have bad/buggy functionality. I want this website to be fun and semi-informative so that I can lean about Code Fellows courses and see design features that I like.
- As a member of the instructional team I want to see clean, well-written, bug-free, feature-rich code that demonstrates the knowledge that the team has gained. 
- As a person interested in attending a code school I want to enjoy using the website and get my results so that I can be better informed about my potential decision to enroll in code school.
- As a current code fellow student 
- As a parent of a person in code school I want to see pretty colors and fancy-looking features so that I know that my money is being put to good use and that I know that I raised a good boy/girl.
- As a potential employer I want 

## Stretch Goals
- As a user I want to see a progress bar so that I know my progress.
- As a developer I want to include a timer so I can lean more about using DateTime and so that i can give the user an overwhelming sense of anxiety to simulate timed labs in CF courses.
- As developer I want to style the site to be as similar to the code fellows website as possible so that I can lean about good design.
